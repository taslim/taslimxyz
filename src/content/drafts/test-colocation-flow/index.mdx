This is a test post to verify the new directory-per-post structure with
colocated images.

<Figure
  src="hero.jpg"
  alt="Test hero image"
  caption="This image is colocated with the post in source and mirrored to public/images/blog/"
/>

## Testing the workflow

The new structure allows us to:

1. Keep images next to their posts in `src/content/blog/<slug>/`
2. Reference them via stable `/images/blog/<slug>/...` paths
3. Get full Next.js image optimization through `Figure`
4. Keep public assets in sync via the sync-blog-images script

Pretty cool!
