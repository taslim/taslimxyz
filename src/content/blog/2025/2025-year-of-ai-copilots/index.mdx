My wife and I started the new year with a relaxing trip to the Central Coast of
California—exploring the historic sites of San Luis Obispo and the stunning
views at Pismo Beach. Before the trip, I decided to build a custom Gem to serve
as our sidekick through it all. If you're unfamiliar,
[Gems](https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15146780?hl=en) allow you to
reuse prompts for your Google Gemini chats. You can also include files in a
Gem's knowledge base to better ground the chatbot. They're similar to ChatGPT's
[Custom GPTs](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8554397-creating-a-gpt).

The idea for the Gem was simple:

- Help plan a trip, either from scratch or by leveraging an existing guide.
- Serve as an on-demand resource throughout the trip, making recommendations and
  retrieving information with ease.

I turned to a good friend of mine who runs a
[travel blog](https://samefootprints.com/). She's a pro at crafting
[custom travel guides](https://samefootprints.com/same-footprints-guide/), and
her sample guide for the Central Coast was the perfect foundation. She had
previously created a tailored Miami guide for me in 2023 that I absolutely
loved. With her Central Coast guide in hand, Gemini and I collaborated on an
itinerary. It became my daily ritual to check in with Gemini for everything from
activity reminders to menu suggestions. When I got to a restaurant on our list,
I would ask it, _"what's the recommended dish to get here?"_ Each time, the Gem
would pull directly from the guide, seamlessly blending my friend's expertise
with AI's ability to synthesize and retrieve information instantly. It felt like
the best of both worlds—human expertise paired with AI superpowers.

From this experience, I've developed a framework that will guide how I think
about and approach consumer AI this year:

- **Simplicity beats complexity**. With AI advancing at breakneck speed, it's
  tempting to get caught up in the race and feel left behind. I get it. People
  are already talking about agents. Sam Altman says OpenAI will achieve AGI this
  year. But maybe it's time we take a step back. Let's return to the basics and
  explore what we can still accomplish with existing, commercial-grade LLM
  chatbots. As Anthropic aptly states in their
  [blog on _building effective agents_](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents),
  _"When building applications with LLMs, we recommend finding the simplest
  solution possible, and only increasing complexity when needed. This might mean
  not building agentic systems at all."_

- **AI copilots can truly 10x your life.** _Travel With Me_, as I named the Gem
  I built for the Central Coast trip, is just the beginning. I deliberately
  designed it to be open-ended, so I can reuse it for other trips this year.
  Beyond _Travel With Me_, I've already created _FitCoach_ to support my half
  marathon training and _Blog SideKick_, my personal editor-in-chief for this
  blog. Building these tools isn't just for tech enthusiasts or developers;
  anyone can do it. There's room for all of us to create copilots that make life
  easier and more fulfilling.

- **Human expertise remains essential**. While there's a rush in the AI industry
  to automate everything, I'm not here to optimize my life solely for the
  efficiency of it. Quality still matters to me. There's little value in
  retrieving information quickly if it's wrong or lacks depth. My trip was made
  extraordinary because of my friend's guide. Likewise, my half marathon
  training is built on tailored advice from another friend who truly understands
  my goals and challenges. AI may be fast, but the depth and nuance of human
  input are still essential. This may change tomorrow but that is the case
  today.

I am a naturally curious person and there is so much more I want to explore with
this technology. Gems and Custom GPTs are only one part of the equation. I hope
sharing my experience inspires you to think about small pockets of your life
experiences that could be made better with a touch of LLM magic—and that it
encourages you to experiment boldly.

The potential is enormous, and as I refine these systems, I look forward to
sharing my journey and maybe even releasing some of my Custom GPTs and Gemini
Gems publicly.

Here's to building in 2025!
